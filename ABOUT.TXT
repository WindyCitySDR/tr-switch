The open source high peak/average power transmit/receive switch was developed for 
thermal MR applications. It supports high peak power MR imaging applications and 
high average power RF heating. The specifications of v1.0 are:
- Isolation (Tx-port - Rx-port) during transmission: 			-56dB 
- Isolation (Tx-port - Rx-port) during reception:				-57dB 
- Insertion loss during transmission (Tx-port - coil/antenna): 	-0.35dB
- Insertion loss during reception (coil/antenna - Rx port): 	-0.21dB

The switch has been developed at the Berlin Ultrahigh Field Facility (B.U.F.F.) of 
the Max-Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association, Berlin, 
Germany. The documentation for the hardware is made freely available to the community. 

This work is part of the Open Source Imaging Initiative (www.opensourceimaging.org)
and was supported in part by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF, 
KMU innovativ Medizintechnik, 3-in-1 THERAHEAT, FKZ 13GW0102A and 13GW0102B) and an
advanced grant of the European Research Council (ERC AdG 743077).
